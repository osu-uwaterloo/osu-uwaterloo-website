**Waterloo osu! Cup 15 (Wo!C15)** was a two-tiered 2v2  osu! standard tournament ran during the Fall 2022 term by **jiaxunjason**.

**Wo!C15** was the first to have 2 separate tiers to better accomodate the wide range in players' skill levels.
6 digits were allowed to join teams without consideration of the team size limit.
