**Waterloo osu! Cup 12 (Wo!C12)** was a 2v2 osu! standard tournament ran during the Fall 2022 term by **Tedyee** (Wayakuyee).
**Wo!C12** featured a huge spread in difficulty between rounds - ranging from 3* in the first round to 6* in grand finals.

As a gimmick, HD2 (the low approach rate hidden map) was by far the hardest slot for each round, featuring maps such as [Snow Irony [wakaranai_]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1351876), [Mad Head Love [NEWTON'S LOVE INSANE]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1429536#osu/3205010), and [Satori De Pon! [no u]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/46502#osu/201523). These maps were so difficult that **Tedyee** offered significant prizes for FC'ing these maps in match (1 month supporter, $69, and $727 respectively)!
