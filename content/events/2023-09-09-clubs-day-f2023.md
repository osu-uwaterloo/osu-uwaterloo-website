osu!uwaterloo will be back for clubs and societies day this fall! While we do not have a confirmed booth location yet, we will most likely have a booth! Drop by to play a bit of osu! on our super awesome PC setup and show off your skills to all the passer-by-ers, or just say hi and meet some of our existing members.

Clubs and Societies day will be running on Sept 21, 2023 from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM as well as on Sept 22, 2023 from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM. Club booths will be spread throughout SLC (Great Hall, Multi-Purpose Room, Marketplace).
